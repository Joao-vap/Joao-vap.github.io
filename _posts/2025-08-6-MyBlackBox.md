- Talk about the kid's black box and the program they took part in the Bhering Academy. How close their fear are to mine and how they in some ways can deal with it better... and so could I years ago. 

- Start talking about my black box:
  - Finding myself to be an atheist;
  - Entering CMBH 
    - how i 'esquivei' the FO's;
    - How i failed the first time, what changed for the second time around;
  - Starting Sports;
  - Experimenting while a child with plants and scavating the bat;
  - Walking with my grandmother (throwing money in the way, how innocent);
  - My first "love", what is about the memories and dreams I hold of this time??? The train and the dinossaurs;
  - My obcession wit coins - the coins on the floor;
  - My obcession with rocks - probabily the most of science i had besides the bat (oh how much i wanted a telescope);
  - The somewhat frequent shootings and the footbal experience (i learned how to drink water!);
  - I went to CERN!! Obcessed with the friends i made there;
  - Orienteering and learning to take care of myself making friends and dealing with problems;
  - My grandfather, its scape from the countryside and his way of doing things (Kart, Billets) (death?);
  - My grandmother, her love for me, her stroke - the glimpses of reality and her death;
  - What we played with other kids in Henricao.
  - Selling chup-chups;
