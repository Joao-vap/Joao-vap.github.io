collection: publications
permalink: /publication/CLT-Intransitive-Dice
excerpt: 'Intransive dice D(1),…,D(l) are dice such that D(1) has advantage with respect to D(2), dice D(2) has advantage with respect to D(3) and so on, up to D(l), which has advantage over D(1). In this twofold work, we present: first, (deterministic) results on existence of general intransitive dice. Second and mainly, a central limit theorem for the vector of normalized victories of a die against the next one in the list when the faces of a die are i.i.d. random variables and all dice are independent, but different dice may have distinct distributions associated to, as well as they may have distinct number of faces. From this central limit theorem we derive a criteria to assure that the asymptotic probability of observing intransitive dice is null, which applies for many cases, including all continuous distributions and many discrete ones.'
